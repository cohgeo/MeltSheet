# MeltSheet
These scripts create and run a conductive cooling thermal model of an impact melt sheet.  
"MeltSheet.R" is the thermal model for the Morokweng melt sheet.  
"MeltSheet_long.R" runs the Morokweng model for an exended time interval by running the model piecewise.  
"MeltSheet_Chicxulub.R" is the thermal model for the Chicxulub melt sheet.
